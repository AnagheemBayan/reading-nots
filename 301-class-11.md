# Authorizing requests and identifying your application
Every request your application sends to the Books API needs to identify your application to Google


# two ways to identify your application: 
1. using an OAuth 2.0 token 
1.  using the application's API key.

* Authorizing requests with OAuth 2.0

- OAuth 2.0: Whenever your application requests private user data, it must send an OAuth 2.0 token along with the request. Your application first sends a client ID and, possibly, a client secret to obtain a token. You can generate OAuth 2.0 credentials for web applications, service accounts, or installed applications.


- API keys: A request that does not provide an OAuth 2.0 token must send an API key. The key identifies your project and provides API access, quota, and reports.
