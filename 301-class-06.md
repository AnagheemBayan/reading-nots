# What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. When we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. Rather, the creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.
