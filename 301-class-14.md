# Database Normalization
is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

* The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. 


# Reasons for Database Normalization
There are three main reasons to normalize a database:

- The first is to minimize duplicate data,
- the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues,
-  and the third is to simplify queries.


# Duplicated information presents two problems:
1- It increases storage and decrease performance.

2- It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.


# There are three common forms of database normalization:

1. First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

1. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

1. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
